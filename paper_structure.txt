* Introduction
	* I need to incorporate Ariel's suggestions into my master's thesis,
		then I can pull the paper's introduction from my thesis,
		right?
* (Methods??) Theoretical adjustments to evolution mapping
	* sigma12 tilde
	* A_s as a shape parameter
	! Come up with a new name for the MEMNeC. It's unpopular...
* (Methods) Usage of Cassandra-Linear, breakdown of features
	* Uncertainty emulator
	* sigma12 emulator
	* Massive and massless emulators
	? Or should I refer the reader to a README on the repo's page?? e.g. for
	    which
		functions do which things...
* (Results) Training and testing errors
	* Predicted uncertainties versus actual certainties: much noisier, probably
		due to the strong performance of the main emulator.
* Discussion, conclusion, future work
	* Comparison to existing emulators with massive neutrino support.
	* I'm still working on the no-wiggle, de-wiggled, and dimensionless power
	    spectra.
	* Limited priors -> it would be great if we could repeat this work on CLASS,
	    for example.
