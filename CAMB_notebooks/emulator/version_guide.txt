Version 1 was broken because we hadn't fixed the h factor yet, I think...

Version 2 (modularized version 1, B)
    * introduced modularized code
    * was broken because the h factor fix introduced an h reduction crash,
        so we don't have all of the cells.

Version 3 (C) is looking great, but it remains to be seen whether there are still
    "hopeless" cells... but if we can solve everything, then we'll be in a really
    good position...
    
Version 4 (D) corrects the 

Version E (modularized version 4)

Version F
    * Now we're using COMET priors. We never fixed the "hopeless" cosmologies,
        but at least they're relatively infrequent.

Version G
    * Massless emulator no longer uses As as an input parameter
    * Massive emulator now matches sigma12 of counterpart cosmology with massless
        neutrinos, not the sigma12 of the input cosmology.
        
    G5: I'll try to use my own interpolator, maybe that will work    
    G6 scrap my plans, let's just use Andrea's interpolator
    G7: I've made a couple of modifications to my approach possibly, let's check
        if it works this time.
