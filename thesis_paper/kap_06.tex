\chapter{Results and Analysis}

In this chapter, we will discuss the performance of a two-emulator setup
built using the default configuration of CL: both the massless- and
massive-neutrino emulators appraised here use the COMET priors
(table~\ref{tab: COMET_priors}), $N_k = 300$, and $N_s = 3000$ for both the
training and testing data sets.

The final training LHS had an $s^*$ of 0.07972 in the massive case and 
0.02274 in the massless case. The final testing LHS had an $s^*$ of 0.07275 in 
the massive case and 0.02015 in the massless case. All numbers have been 
rounded to four significant figures.

\section{Quantifying the Performance of the Emulator}

Before I even show any results for this emulator, I would like to motivate the 
challenge of gauging the accuracy and reliability of the emulator. Since we 
have to quantify performance over a hypervolume of parameter space, there is 
no concept of, for example, a chi-squared test that can applied here. So I am 
trying to pre-empt objections like those raised by Stella.

I would like to include a brief review of the relevant literature to explain 
the kinds of performance metrics that are most commonly applied in emulator 
papers (as I remember, largely percent-level bounds when comparing against 
ground truth data sets). Then, I would like to break down Ariel's arguments 
for why absolute error is of greater consequence to us than relative errors.

For the purpose of this paper, we use the weak and approximate performance 
metric of simply generating a large number of additional CAMB spectra and 
comparing them to the predictions of the emulator.

\section{Percent versus Absolute Errors on Random Cosmologies}

This will be a fairly short section, basically just showing the plot of 5000 
error curves in these two ways. I may focus in on different k-ranges, but the 
error curves are currently quite flat, so I don't think that would be a good 
use of space.

Furthermore, I will try to select a couple of cosmologies out of the 5000 
(maybe a low-error case and a high-error case) as examples of the performance 
on just one at a time. But I'm not sure how insightful that will be, I don't 
know if that will tell the reader a whole lot.

\textcolor{green}{redo the numbers in this next paragraph}

The current state of the massless-neutrino emulator features sub-0.1\% error 
for the vast majority of scales, with the exception of some wild fluctuations  
between k=0.09 and 0.2 / Mpc. Outside of this range, the errors tend to 
sub-0.01\% in the large-scale regime and sub-0.005\% in the small-scale 
regime. Please refer to figures XXX through XXX for illustrations thereof.


\section{Performance in Different Parameters}

Here, I will either include color plots or, as Dante suggests, monochrome 
plots with error as one axis and parameter value as the other (i.e. $k$ 
fixed). Then, if I haven't tightened the $\sigma_{12}$ performance by the time 
of submission, I can talk about how this is the most promising avenue for 
refinement of the emulator. In any case, I plan to spend some time talking 
about \textit{why} parameter x is the current biggest problem for the 
emulator. 


\section{Improvement from Two-emulator Solution}
\label{sec: 2emu_improvement}

To justify our decision and to quantify the improvement from this approach, we
have prepared \textcolor{orange}{some} plots in
section~\ref{sec: 2emu_improvement}.

plots of the massive-neutrino cosmology evaluating massless-neutrino
cosmologies.}
