\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The greatest of our thanks go to our advisors Ariel G. S\'{a}nchez and Andrea
Pezzotta, without whose generous time and thoughtful contributions this thesis
would be mostly empty.

We thank Daniel Farrow for his work during the CAKE 2021 workshop, which
served as the basis for the vital lhc.py script in the Cassandra-Linear
package.
