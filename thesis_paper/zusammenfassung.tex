proofreader; we'll simply cut these out shortly before submission.}
\textcolor{orange}{Notes to myself--I already know what I would like to do to
enhance these areas.} \textcolor{green}{I need to add citations / 
justification for the claims here, either by generating more plots or by going
back and looking through the papers I used to get started with this project.}
\textcolor{red}{I have some confusion about this area and I would appreciate
feedback from the proofreader.}

``The goal of this project is to produce an emulator of the linear-theory
power spectrum based on evolution mapping'' (A. G. S\'{a}nchez, private
communication). In particular, this paper seeks to extend the evolution
mapping scheme of \cbib{San21} to massive-neutrino cosmologies by applying a
correction
factor to results from emulators built on massless-neutrino simulations. We
find that the scalar mode amplitude $A_s$ can be used to quantify the
suppression of structure growth due to massive neutrinos. Consequently, by
including this parameter, we can successfully train over the physical density
of the universe in massive neutrinos. We introduce a new emulation code,
Cassandra-Linear, which combines this expanded parameter space with evolution
mapping. We include various error statistics and show that the emulator
performs roughly at the level of error associated with CAMB itself
\textcolor{green}{Do I have a citation for the error associated with CAMB?}
