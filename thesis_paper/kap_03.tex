\chapter{Expansion of the Parameter Space}

% Section on messing around

Here, I will talk about the playing-around that we did, to discover that
$A_s$ assisted in the prediction of the suppression due to massive neutrinos.
Specifically, we just need to add $A_s$ to the set of cosmological parameters
over which we train our GPR and then we can treat $\omega_\nu$ like a shape
parameter.

% Maybe it would make more sense to have the large cass-L chapter focus on the
% creation of a massless-neutrino emulator and THEN a smaller chapter focusing
% on all the changes necessary for it to become a massive-neutrino emulator.
% BUT! As of 25-08-23, I'm running way behind on writing actual content for
% this thesis. I can't risk redoing all the section headers again. We're
% going to proceed under the current scheme and MAYBE allow ourselves to redo
% it shortly before submission.

So, our massive-neutrino emulator will be trained over six cosmological
parameters: $\omega_b$, $\omega_c$, $n_s$, $\sigma_{12}$, $A_s$, and
$\omega_\nu$. In other words, to predict a linear non-neutrino-matter power
spectrum $\hat{y}$, the emulator will accept as an input $x$ these six
parameters.

Besides its relevance to the neutrino suppression of the small-scale power
spectrum, $A_s$ appears to be an evolution parameter. Therefore, when the
emulator discussion branches into the massless- and massive-neutrino cases
(refer to section~\ref{sec: 2emu_intro} for the beginning and motivation of
this), the reader should keep in mind that the dimension of the parameter
space decreases in the massless-neutrino case by \textit{two}--$\omega_\nu$ 
obviously must vanish because we here assume $\omega_\nu=0$. However, $A_s$
also vanishes because, without massive neutrinos, $A_s$ reduces to an
evolution parameter and is therefore redundant with $\sigma_{12}$.

% What happens to A_s in the massless-neutrino case? Is it fixed at the
% default for model 0? I'm pretty sure it is!

Remember to explain \textit{why} the prediction of these asymptotes means that $A_s$ will capture all of the unruly behavior of neutrinos. What theory motivates such a judgment? Or are we only guessing?
