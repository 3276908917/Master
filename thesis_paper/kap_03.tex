\chapter{Expansion of the Parameter Space}

Here, I will talk about the playing-around that we did, to discover that
$A_s$ assisted in the prediction of the suppression due to massive neutrinos.

% Section on messing around

Besides its relevance to the neutrino suppression of the small-scale power
spectrum, $A_s$ appears to be an evolution parameter. Therefore, when we
showcase the performance of emulators without massive neutrinos, 

Remember to explain \textit{why} the prediction of these asymptotes means that $A_s$ will capture all of the unruly behavior of neutrinos. What theory motivates such a judgment? Or are we only guessing?
