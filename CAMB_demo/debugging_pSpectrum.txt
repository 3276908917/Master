We've been slowly bringing our results more in line with Ariel's. Positive steps so far:
* Multiplied the x axis by h to agree on units
* Evaluated the curves only at the redshifts given in the file
* Stick to linear, rather than non-linear spectra
* Double check that the neutrinos are really registered.
    Our problem was setting neutrino values directly; for some reason CAMB ignores these fields.
* Confirm that that to which you are comparing is looking at the same constituents
    as you are. For example, I had the problem of looking at the full matter power spectrum
    when I was supposed to look just at the matter power spectrum in baryons and CDM.

Still, there's a little disagreement at the small scales:
    it seems like my spectra there are too low in amplitude

What else could be the problem?

* Effective number of neutrinos 2.046?
* Power spectrum of baryons + CDM?

Speculation
* Does "accurate_massive_neutrinos" have anything to do with it?
    (model.py)

Questions
* What is the difference between get_matter_power_spectrum
    (assuming the CAMBparams object has NonLinear = NonLinear_none)
    and get_linear_matter_power_spectrum
    (results.py)
