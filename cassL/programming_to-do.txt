0. LHC.py needs to be rewritten until we can track the increase in cube
    performance over x trials.
-------- After thesis
1. Collapse old functions
    a. Model / wrapper comparisons in camb_interface.py
    b. Get rid of Andrea code in camb_interface.py
    c. LHC.py should really only consist of build_LHCs and get_comparator
        endless_mode can be a flag, otherwise we take the best of x cubes
        unit can be a flag, otherwise we scale according to given priors
2. Documentation for EVERY function, in line with the format used in COMET
3. 
4. Unit tests for EVERYTHING
