Version 1 was broken because we hadn't fixed the h factor yet, I think...

Version 2 (modularized version 1, B)
    * introduced modularized code
    * was broken because the h factor fix introduced an h reduction crash,
        so we don't have all of the cells.

Version 3 (C) is looking great, but it remains to be seen whether there are still
    "hopeless" cells... but if we can solve everything, then we'll be in a really
    good position...
    
Version 4 (D) corrects the 

Version E (modularized version 4)

Version F
    * Now we're using COMET priors. We never fixed the "hopeless" cosmologies,
        but at least they're relatively infrequent.

Version G
    * Massless emulator no longer uses As as an input parameter
    * Massive emulator now matches sigma12 of counterpart cosmology with massless
        neutrinos, not the sigma12 of the input cosmology.
        
    G2: ?    
        
    G3: ?    
        
    G4: let's rerun the code this time double checking that the cells line up
        with the inputs (some file read mistake I guess)    
        
    G5: Let's get the interpolator in action instead of the direct evaluation
        approach
        
    G6: It didn't work, there must be something wrong with all of our
        approaches. We'll work on fixing them, but right now it's most urgent
        that we simply figure out whence the excess emulator error comes. We'll
        rip Andrea's code and generate a training set using that!
