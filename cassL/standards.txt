1. All cosmology configuration dictionaries should follow the same format in
    order to be correctly interpreted by the various functions in this package.
    All keys map to floating point numbers.
    The keys are as follows:
     
    'ombh2' physical density of the Universe in baryons
    'omch2' physical density of the Universe in CDM (Cold Dark Matter)
    'n_s' spectral index
    'A_s' scalar mode amplitude
    'OmK' fractional density of the Universe in curvature
    'OmL' fractional density of the Universe in DE (Dark Energy)
    'h' The hubble parameter 
        PAY ATTENTION! This is NOT H0. It's h. h is H0 / 100, remember.
    'w0' The w_0 parameter in the CPL (Chevallier-Polarski-Lindner) DE EoS
        (Equation of State). This corresponds also to w in the constant-DE
        model
    'wa' The w_a parameter in the CPL DE EoS 
    'sigma12' the linear-theory RMS amplitude of mass fluctuations in spheres of
        radius 12 Mpc
    'omnuh2' physical density of the Universe in massive neutrinos
        If both this and 'mnu' are missing, the program
        automatically assumes that both are zero. Furthermore, 'nnu_massive'
        will be treated as zero regardless of its actual value.
!!!!'mnu' neutrino mass (but if we're using a normal hierarchy, which neutrino
        gets this mass??) 
        If both this and 'omnuh2' are missing, the program
        automatically assumes that both are zero. Furthermore, 'nnu_massive'
        will be treated as zero regardless of its actual value.
    'nnu_massive' the number of massive neutrino species.
        If both 'omnuh2' and 'mnu' are missing from the
        dictionary, this value will be ignored and treated as zero.
    
    Keep in mind that the following parameters are never explicitly
    used: 'OmL'.
    Therefore, the 'OmL' field is not always updated to its true value.
