        "MEGA": the original goal for this project, which unfortunately
            suffered from too many empty cells. The code has gone through
            several crucial bug fixes since switching to a different set of
            priors, so we need to test this prior suite again and re-assess the
            rate of empty cells.
        "classic": a prior range with widths in between those of "COMET" and
            "MEGA." We need to test this prior suite again to see if it still
            suffers from a large number of empty cells.
        "COMET" as of 19.06.23, this is the default for the emulator. It is
            the most restrictive of the three options and is intended to
            totally eliminate the problem of empty cells, so that a complete
            LHC can be used to train a demonstration emulator. The hope is for
            the demonstration emulator trained over such priors to be extremely
            accurate due to the very narrow permissible parameter values.

    @massive_neutrinos should be set to False when one is training the emulator
        for massless neutrinos. This is because the massless neutrino emulator
        should be using two fewer parameters--A_s and omega_nu_h2 are no longer
