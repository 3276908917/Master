I'll still need to read that COMET paper

These emulators need to be available on all devices:
* MEGA priors, 5k emulator
	WE'RE STILL USING THE INTERPOLATOR FOR THIS ONE
	> train on laptop, test BRIEFLY
	* needs its own test cube
* Classic priors, 5k emulator
	* build on laptop
	* train
	* test BRIEFLY
	* needs its own test cube
* COMET priors, 10k emulator
	FOR ALL NON-5Ks, I'M USING DIRECT EVALUATION
	* 5k emulator (300 k points)
	* 4k emu
		* buil
			lhc.multithread_unit_LHC_builder(6, 4000, num_workers=8, label="unit_4k_massive_train")
		* fill
	* 3k emu
		* buil
			lhc.multithread_unit_LHC_builder(6, 3000, num_workers=8, label="unit_3k_massive_train")
		* fill
	* 6k
		$ buil
			lhc.multithread_unit_LHC_builder(6, 6000, num_workers=8, label="unit_6k_massive_train")
		>> fill
	* 7k
		$ build hypercube
			best_sep: 0.06922235689340223
		$ fill hypercube

	* (these do not need their own test cubes)

* COMET 5k, 400 k points
	* Comet 5k, 500 k points
		* fill train
		* fill test
	* Comet 5k, 200 k points
		* fill train
		* fill test
	* Comet 5k, 100 k points? 250? 150?
		* fill train
		* fill test

* Runs of varying LHC-quality
	* Worst of the worst
	* Middling
	* Best that we found
	* (No extra test cubes necessary--we should always be comparing to the same
		cube)
	* In case the resulting plot is too coarse, we can always subdivide this
		interval further; the coarseness I have suggested right now is
		purely due to the limited time we have.

$ Ariel needs to get back to me about the seminar.

Andrea needs to give me the summary of the results of last year's
	workshop

I'm really struggling with the terminology and math.
	Maybe we should make flash cards?
