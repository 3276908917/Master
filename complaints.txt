I'll still need to read that COMET paper

These emulators need to be available on all devices:
$ MEGA priors, 5k emulator
	WE'RE STILL USING THE INTERPOLATOR FOR THIS ONE
	$ train on laptop, test BRIEFLY
	$ needs its own test cube
> Classic priors, 5k emulator
	$ train
	* test BRIEFLY
	>> needs its own test cube
	WE'RE STILL USING THE INTERPOLATOR FOR THIS ONE
* COMET priors, more samples
	FOR ALL NON-5Ks, I'M USING DIRECT EVALUATION
	$ 5k emulator (300 k points)
		$ buil
		$ fill

	$ 4k emu
		$ buil
			lhc.multithread_unit_LHC_builder(6, 4000, num_workers=8, label="unit_4k_massive_train")
		$ fill
	$ 3k emu
		$ buil
			lhc.multithread_unit_LHC_builder(6, 3000, num_workers=8, label="unit_3k_massive_train")
		$ fill
	$ 6k
		$ buil
			lhc.multithread_unit_LHC_builder(6, 6000, num_workers=8, label="unit_6k_massive_train")
		$ fill
	$ 7k
		$ build hypercube
			best_sep: 0.06922235689340223
		$ fill hypercube

	I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WORK ANYMORE. LET'S BUILD A DIFFERENT HYPERCUBE HERE INSTEAD OF SSH'ING INTO
	WORK.

	* (these do not need their own test cubes, but should re-use the one currently being probed on the MPE
	work desktop)

* COMET 5k, 400 k points
	* Comet 5k, 500 k points
		* fill train
		* fill test
	* Comet 5k, 200 k points
		>> fill train
		* fill test
	* Comet 5k, 100 k points? 250? 150? Let's do 100 for now
		$ fill train
		$ fill test

* Runs of varying LHC-quality
	* We should always use the same test cube

	* Worst of the worst
		* buil
		* fill
	* Middling 1
		* buil
		* fill
	* Middling 2
		* buil
		* fill
	* Best that we found: just re-use the standard 5k 300k
	* (No extra test cubes necessary--we should always be comparing to the same
		cube)
	* In case the resulting plot is too coarse, we can always subdivide this
		interval further; the coarseness I have suggested right now is
		purely due to the limited time we have.

I'm really struggling with the terminology and math.
	Maybe we should make flash cards?
