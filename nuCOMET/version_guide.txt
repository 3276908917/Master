Version 1 was broken because we hadn't fixed the h factor yet, I think...

Version 2 was broken because the h factor fix introduced an h reduction crash,
so we don't have all of the cells.

Version 3 is looking great, but it remains to be seen whether there are still
    "hopeless" cells... but if we can solve everything, then we'll be in a really
    good position...
